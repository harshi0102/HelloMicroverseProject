<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## 💻 Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

A linter is a tool that checks your code for errors and provides suggestions for how to improve your code. By using a linter, you can identify and fix issues before they become larger problems.

You can configure a linter to check multiple files in your project, which is especially helpful when working on larger projects with many files. You can also use the configuration file of your linter as a blueprint for your project's coding conventions finally improving the overall quality of your code and making your development process more efficient.

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.
